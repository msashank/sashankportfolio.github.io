                <h2 class="project-title">Lightweighting a part using nTopology</h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    I designed and optimized a holder for a Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printed part to remove excess unpolymerized resin using centrifugation. After 3D printing, a typical green part often retains leftover unpolymerized resin, either trapped in cavities or adhered to the surface. To address this issue, I developed a centrifuge-compatible holder that facilitates the removal of this excess resin effectively.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The holder design features a slanted surface that supports a perforated sheet on which the printed part rests. Below this slanted surface, a conical section collects the excess resin that is spun off during the centrifugation process. The structure was fabricated using PLA, chosen for its lightweight and rigidity, and designed to withstand forces generated by spinning at up to 300 rpm.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The initial design was created in SolidWorks, focusing on a robust bulk structure to ensure functionality. To achieve significant weight reduction without compromising structural integrity, I used the lightweighting feature in nTopology. This optimization process involved strategically reducing material usage while maintaining the mechanical strength necessary to endure centrifugation forces.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Additionally, I enhanced the design by incorporating a smooth surface in the conical collection area to improve resin drainage and by refining the slanted face to securely accommodate the perforated sheet. The final optimized holder demonstrated remarkable improvements, achieving a mass reduction of 71.5% and a volume reduction of 74.7% compared to the original design.

                <h2 class="project-title">Solar Water Heater</h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    I undertook a project aimed at creating an electronic-less system capable of boiling 1 liter of water in under an hour, catering to backpackers and camping enthusiasts. The main objectives for this project were to eliminate electrical components, ensure ease of assembly and disassembly, achieve a lightweight structure, and maintain cost-effective manufacturing.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The product was divided into two main components: the solar concentrator and the solar receiver. The solar concentrator was designed to reflect solar radiation with minimal losses towards the receiver. This optics-based design utilized basic ray tracing to efficiently direct sunlight. The solar receiver, on the other hand, was tasked with absorbing the concentrated solar irradiance. The receiver design emphasized heat transfer, specifically minimizing heat loss to the environment.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    To optimize heat retention, the receiver was insulated while still allowing effective radiation transfer into the absorber. Material selection played a critical role, guided by Ashby charts to balance performance and manufacturability. Cosmetic choices, such as the paint job, were also optimized to enhance radiative heat transfer. A one-dimensional finite difference heat transfer model determined that the system could heat 1 liter of water in just 44 minutes. The design was further simplified by eliminating fasteners, reducing assembly complexity.

                <h2 class="project-title">Reverse Engineering - Metronome</h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    This reverse engineering project focused on the Ueteto SLM-350 metronome to understand its design and manufacturing process. The project was chosen due to the intricate escapement mechanism and gear assembly, which embody over 200 years of iterative development and adaptation to modern manufacturing methods. The Ueteto metronome represents a high-volume, low-cost product designed for mass production.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The analysis covered material selection, design for assembly, part manufacturing, and economic considerations to identify potential improvements for the current design. Initially, the Ueteto metronome was disassembled and each part was measured and modeled in 3D CAD. This documentation of each part and subassembly enabled a detailed design for assembly (DFA) analysis, revealing a theoretical minimum part count of 40% and a practical assembly efficiency of 57.5%.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Parts that exceeded the practical minimum were evaluated for potential reduction. However, it was determined that reducing parts further would not be economically viable due to increased manufacturing costs. For hardware optimization, six different types of machine screws were identified in the product assembly. Notably, two of these screws featured custom thread pitches, which could be replaced with standardized alternatives. The hardware variety could be reduced to two types of standardized screws: M2.5x4.5 machine screws and M3x0.6-6mm machine screws, simplifying assembly and reducing costs.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    A material analysis revealed opportunities for improvement by standardizing the plastics used in injection-molded parts to cost-effective ABS. Additionally, the pendulum weights, currently made from copper, could be substituted with a more economical material such as low-carbon steel, offering significant cost savings without compromising functionality.

                <h2 class="project-title">Friction Stir Welding using Hybrid tool pins</h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    This project aims to compare the effects of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) using square and triangular tool pins on the mechanical properties and microstructures of AA6082-T6 Aluminium Alloy. Two aluminum alloy plates of dimensions 150mm x 75mm x 6mm (n=3) were friction stir welded using square and triangular tool pins at rotational speeds of 900, 1100, and 1400 rpm. The welding was performed using a vertical milling machine at a depth of 5.8mm.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    After welding, the plates were cut into dog-bone structures and subjected to tensile and yield strength testing using a Universal Testing Machine (UTM). Additionally, the remainder of the plates was sectioned into smaller samples to analyze the microstructures in the Nugget Zone (NZ), Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ), and Thermo-Mechanically Affected Zone (TMAZ).
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The results indicated that welds performed with the triangular tool pin exhibited superior mechanical properties and finer grain structures compared to those welded with the square tool pin. In both cases, welds conducted at lower rotational speeds demonstrated better mechanical properties, highlighting the influence of process parameters on weld quality and microstructure.
